#What is static_content?
static_content provides an easy way of defining static content in your application.

#Usage

In your view, just add:

```erb
<%=c :sidebar_content, default: "Placeholder Sidebar Content" %>
```

Please note that a `default` option is required. If it hasn't been created, it will be created upon the first request.

This is intended to be used with admin panels such as Typus or ActiveAdmin.
